            <h1>About Culture Hack Data</h1>
          </header>

          <p>We&rsquo;ve created a simple web service to make it easier to discover and find out about the growing number of open data sources and providers within the arts and culture communities.</p>

<p>As well as linking to each of the data sources, we&rsquo;ve also tried to describe what each dataset is about, the size of each dataset, how easy it is to use and the license it&rsquo;s released under.</p>

<p>Most importantly, if we know about <strong>interesting hacks or prototypes</strong> made with the data, we've linked to those, too.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s a dataset or a prototype we&rsquo;re missing, you can add it. All of the entries here are just plain old-fashioned text files held over on <a href="https://github.com/culturehack/data-tool">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://github.com/culturehack/data-tool">instructions on GitHub</a>  about the format we use, and how to submit a &ldquo;pull request&rdquo; for us to add your contribution. It doesn&rsquo;t take long, and you can do it all online.</p>

<p>This tool is an experiment in the most simple way to catalogue data in a way that's 'native to the web' and the way creative technologists work. In the future we want to make this a way of finding out about the creative things people have done with data, as much as the data itself. We're working on ways that you can associate prototypes with data sources, or write introductions to prototypes that help non-technical users understand just how awesome the prototypes are. </p>

<p>If you have ideas about how to do this, we'd love to chat to you.</p>
