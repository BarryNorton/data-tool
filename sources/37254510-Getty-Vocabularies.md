The Getty vocabularies contain *"structured terminology for art, architecture, decorative arts and other material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, and bibliographic materials."* 

Basically - they're huge cross-referenced lists of ideas and people in art history scholarship.

The [Art & Architecture Thesaurus® (AAT)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/index.html), the [Union List of Artists Names ® (ULAN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html), the [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names® (TGN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html), and the [Cultural Objects Name Authority® (CONA)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/index.html) are copyrighted by the J. Paul Getty Trust. 

All four of the Getty vocabularies are [due to be published as Linked Open Data (LOD)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/lod/index.html) in 2014/15. It is anticipated that the data will be published under the ODC_BY 1.0 license.

All can be used through a web interface, sample data is available to download, and there is a web service available.

Extensive [training materials](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/training.html) describing the different vocabularies are available.

It is possible to [contribute back](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/contribute.html) to the project, but only if you're a recognised institution.


## Used In Anger

This section is for detailing any prototypes made with this data. We haven't found any examples yet: let us know if you've made something.

## Technical Details

The vocabularies are available over a web service API  [(SOAP, documented in a pdf.)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/vocab_web_services.pdf)

The data dictionaries and other documentation describe the release formats and content of the Getty vocabularies. Standards mentioned include  Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), LIDO and CDWA Lite XML Schema. There is some kind of OAI harvesting protocol in place.

A draft set of redirects to HTML views are currently available, in advance of the full LOD release
