The Fitzwiliam Museum in Cambridge has a collection of antiquities, decorative applied arts, coins and medals, manuscripts and rate books, paintings, drawings and prints - including Rembrandt etchings and handwritten music by Handel. 

The museum has released its collection data - object data, basic record ('tombstone') and extended record data. It **includes images** under a variety of licenses.

Basic data is an outline - enough to identify the object. See this record for a Monet Painting
<http://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/oai/?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk:object-2811&metadataPrefix=pnds_dc>


The data set has around 170,000 records.

## Technical Details

The collection data is available over an API returning JSON. There's [documentation available](http://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/api/docs.php), with some simple examples.


Collection data is also available via an [OAI-PMH service](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) using [PNDS Dublin Core](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/pns/pndsdcxml/). 
Everything is available at permanent identifiers:
http://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/id/entity/identifier[.format]

Extended records are available over a SPARQL service.

The SPARQL data is referenced using the [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/index.html) which "provides definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation." So that's nice. They provide a [beta in-browser test interface](http://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/beta/sparqlhtml/).
