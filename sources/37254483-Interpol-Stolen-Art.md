Interpol, the international policing organisation, [maintain a database of stolen works of art](http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Works-of-art). This is accessible to law enforcement and also some data is openly accessible on their site.


Their site exists partly to raise awareness, and also states that: 
>We encourage not only police, but also art and antiques dealers and owners of works of art to play an active role in the exchange of information. This combined action will strengthen our efforts to curb the erosion of our cultural heritage.

Publicly accessible views on the data are:

* [The ﻿most recent stolen works of art reported to INTERPOL](http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Recent-thefts)
* [Recovered works of art](http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Recovered-items)
* [Recovered but ﻿unclaimed works of art](http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Unclaimed-items)

A single entry contains basic data to help identify the work of art, and an image

## Used In Anger

We haven't found any examples yet: let us know if you've made something.

## Technical Details

It is possible to apply for access to the database, but this largely looks like a scraping job if you wanted to attempt to work with it. The images are certainly copyright, and well, you know, Interpol, right?

The non-public-web access to the database seems to be delivered over a specially encrypted police network.
