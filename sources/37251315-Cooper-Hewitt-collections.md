The Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum has published the metadata about its collection of over 120,000 design-related objects as flat data on [GitHub](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/collection)

The collection is available to browse on the Cooper Hewitt site http://collection.cooperhewitt.org The museum website is being rebuilt around the new collection data http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2012/lost-collection-alpha/


The data is not complete - it's about 60% of the whole collection-  and consists mainly of 'tombstone' data (accession numbers, dates, basic factual information)  with only the bare minimum about most of the objects.


## Used in Anger

The Cooper-Hewitt have a number of examples of use of the collection data and API on their [Labs blog](http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/category/collection-data/)

[Object Phone](http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2013/object-phone/) sends back information about an object if you text its UID to a shortcode.



## Technical Info

The Cooper Hewitt also publish a 'RESTish' API http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api

The museum requests however that you credit them where possible, and contribute any improvements back to the museum. Image rights are managed by [Art Resource](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/image-rights) and are not covered by the release.

The museum suggests using machine tags to link images on Flickr or 3D objects in Thingiverse back to the collection: eg [ch:object=18521077](http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18521077/)
