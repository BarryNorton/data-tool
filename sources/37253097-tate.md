Catalogue entries for the artworks held and the artists represented in the Tate Gallery collection and Tate Archive.

Artwork and Archive entries include

* Artist(s)
* Title
* Date created

* Tate Website URL
* Subject index terms (e.g. Self Portrait - these look to be from a hierarchical controlled vocabulary / ontology / schema)
* Thumbnail URL
* Credit line
* Movements (e.g. Pop Art)

An example entry for an Andy Warhol polaroid:
<https://github.com/tategallery/collection/blob/master/artworks/ar/003/ar00303-97671.json>

Artist entries include

* Name

Andy Warhol himself:
<https://github.com/tategallery/collection/blob/master/artists/w/warhol-andy-2121.json>

Archive items can be anything from posters for exhibitions to items of clothing owned by an artist: the [records on the Tate site](http://archive.tate.org.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=tb-calm&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=7&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Andy%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27Warhol%27%29%29) are fairly dry collection index-card entries.

John Stack has [published presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/stacker2/collections-20) about the history of and future plans for the collection.

## Used in Anger ##


The Tate's own [Mapping the collection](http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/art-maps-mapping-art-collection) project and [outline](http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/art-maps)

Shardcore's [Machine Imagined Art](http://www.shardcore.org/shardpress/index.php/2013/11/12/machine-imagined-artworks-2013/) remixes all of the artwork descriptions to create [new, imaginary artworks](http://www.shardcore.org/cgi-bin/getArtwork.pl?id=3c_13e_9d_6_30_27_2_26_4_c8_120_1d3_11_29_20_)

[Shardcore](http://www.shardcore.org) has also done some work [graphing the  data](http://www.shardcore.org/shardpress/index.php/2013/11/12/machine-imagined-artworks-2013/) , and made a [subject explorer](http://shardcore.org/tatedata/) and [AutoSerota](http://www.shardcore.org/autoserota/) in which Nick Serota introduces the collection.

## Technical Details ##

The data is released as JSON and a flattened CSV, and released on GitHub at <https://github.com/tategallery/collection>

The artworks are referenced by Accession Number, with each artwork in a separate JSON file. The flattened CSV can be used to index the JSON files.

The documentation there is excellent - they get bonus points for the use of the words 'grok' and 'artistic pivot tables'. Someone in there gets it.
