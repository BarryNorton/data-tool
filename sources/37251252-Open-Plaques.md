A community project to find and catalogue heritage plaques (known mainly as 'blue plaques' in the UK).

The data contains the full inscription on each plaque, as well as information about its location, colour and the organisation who erected it.

Full data dumps are avaiable in various formats, as well as live feeds that can be queried.

No API key is required.
