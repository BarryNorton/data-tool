The DCMS Lottery Grants Database holds info about completed grants and grants in progress made by the Lottery distributing bodies. (e.g. the Arts Council) 

It excludes grants made by the Olympic Lottery Distributor and details of applications for Lottery grants.

Each grant record contains the following details:

* Recipient name
* Project description
* Distributing body
* Good cause
* Grant date
* Grant amount
* Local Authority
* Region
* UK Constituency

Data is only available through a bespoke search interface: 
[search](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/Search.aspx) /
[advanced search](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/AdvancedSearch.aspx)

Or via pre-defined summaries:

  * [country/region summary](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/PreDefinedAreaSummary.aspx?ID=PDACR)
  * [local authority summary](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/PreDefinedAreaSummary.aspx?ID=PDALA)
  * [constituency summary](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/PreDefinedAreaSummary.aspx?ID=PDAC)
  * [grants awarded by distributing body](http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/GrantsByDistributingBody.aspx)


It is possible to download the results of an individual search as one or more tab-seperated text files. To access full details of each grant record the user has to click through to an individual page for that grant. 

It's [available on Data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/dcms-lottery-grants-database), but this only links to the bespoke interface.

There appears to be no functionality for bulk download of the dataset.

The Big Lottery Fund is one of the bodies responsible for allocating grants from the money raised by the national lottery.

They publish [records of the grant recipients as CSV data](http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/research/open-data) on their site.
