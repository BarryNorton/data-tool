Art price aggregates and tracks the auction prices fetched by works of art across the world, with data running back to 1987.

A [subscription service](http://web.artprice.com/client/subscriptions/), it is 'THE WORLD LEADER IN ART MARKET INFORMATION', containing

> * 27 million auction prices and indices, detailed auction results 
> * more than 520,000 artists.
> * 4,500 auction houses worldwide.
> * Archives of 360,000 fine art auction sales.
> * 36,000 signatures, monograms and symbols.

There appears to be no way to access the data other than through their search, which heavily obscures useful information in the results to unsubscribed users.

It has, remarkably, some of the worst user interface design I have seen since the late 1990s

## Used In Anger

This section is for detailing any prototypes made with this data. We haven't found any examples yet: let us know if you've made something.

## Technical Details

Smells like 1999 vintage Cold Fusion.
