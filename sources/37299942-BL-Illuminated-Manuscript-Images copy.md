The British Library holds a large collection of Illuminated Manuscripts, many of which are digitised and catalogued on their site. The [images from these manuscripts are available under a Public Domain](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2013/08/get-ready-to-save-as-new-uploads-to-the-catalogue-of-illuminated-manuscripts.html
) dedication.


There are two ways to access the BL manuscript collection: 

* [Digitised Manuscripts](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/) 
complete coverage of many of the items 
* [Catalogue of Illuminated
Manuscripts](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm)
 digital catalogue records and images.

They have [advanced search
tools](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/search2.asp).  
> particularly useful for iconographical searches, since each
image is described individually.  You can search for various terms either in these specific image descriptions or within the wider manuscript records.

## Technical Details

The Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts is based on a Microsoft Access database. It doesn't appear to have an external API available (other than the HTML search interface!). The database doesn't look like it's accessible through the BL's Data platform <http://bnb.data.bl.uk>

Play nicely! Credit the Library if you're using images: they ask you to follow some very sensible goodwill-based [usage guidelines](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/reuse.asp) about respecting the works and contributing to the public domain.
