The [Red Lists](http://icom.museum/resources/red-lists-database/) classify the endangered categories of archaeological objects or works of art in the most vulnerable areas of the world, in order to prevent them from being sold or illegally exported.

Red Lists are NOT a list of actual stolen objects but use examples from legitimate collections to help people _'identify cultural goods protected by legislation and most vulnerable to illicit traffic.'_

Objects are searchable by material, type, region and period.

PDFs of the Red Lists are also available to download.
