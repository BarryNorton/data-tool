> The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, is the world's leading museum of art and design. Our aim is to enrich peopleâ€™s lives by promoting knowledge, understanding and enjoyment of the designed world.

The V&A has a [vast collection of objects](http://collections.vam.ac.uk) covering art, design and fashion. They also have one of the very few [digital art collections](http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/d/digital-art-and-design/) that includes early computer art from the 1960s.

They've made their collections catalogue [available via a simple API](http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/).

The whole collection can be searched at <http://collections.vam.ac.uk> to get a taste of the content available. It currently contains 1.1m+ objects and 375k+ images.

Images can be [used in a non-commercial context](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/information/information_gettingstarted), and there are a few [requirements for rate limiting requests](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/information/information_apiterms) and crediting that you should be aware of in the Terms and Conditions.

## Used in Anger ##

The V&A themselves create products on top of their API - for instance, a [Django app for creating iPad friendly 'labels'](http://www.vam.ac.uk/b/blog/digital-media-va/open-sourcing-digital-labels) for use in galleries which has been [released on GitHub](http://vanda.github.io/DigitalLabels/) under the BSD license.

Other examples may turn up on the [V&A Digital Media Blog](http://www.vam.ac.uk/b/blog/digital-media)

## Technical Details ##

The RESTful API returns JSON, XML (in paginated format), and a JSONP wrapper. 

The documentation at <http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/> is good and includes examples. Rudimentary [query builders in an HTML interface](http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/qb) are available.

Places have been geo-referenced but the data may contain anomalies.

Images can be called directly through the API at a variety of pre-cut sizes.
