The British Museum is one of the most famous museums in the World, and contains collections from across the planet and throughout history.

The museum holds over 3 million individual objects in its collection, around 2 million of which are represented within this database.

The data is modelled using the CIDOC schema in an RDF format, and there is a SPARQL endpoint available. This can be a little tricky to use if youâ€™re used to REST interfaces or CSV files, but there are some example queries you can use.
