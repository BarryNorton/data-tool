* Decorative Art (1914)
* Fine Art (422)
* Local Photographs (1777)
* Natural Science (40)
* Toys (41)

Fields are Asset type, date created, description, ID, linked accession no, orientation, size 

The data files are available to [download from their site](http://www.images.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/assetbank-pavilion/action/browseItems?categoryId=1303&categoryTypeId=1) and includes zip files of images.		

## Used In Anger

[Map the Museum](http://mapthemuseum.org.uk) uses some of this data, and also generates more open data and object images that are 
being released through that site.

[New Cabinets for New Curiosities](http://rpmcollections.wordpress.com/category/digital/new-cabinets-for-new-curiosities/) used the data sets to encourage hacks with the data as part of Brighton Digital Festival 2012

Artist Tom Hamilton created [Wunderflies](http://wunderfly.wordpress.com) using the data, which won funding from the New Cabinets project.

## Technical Details

The data is 3* open: CSV files to the Spectrum Standard. The image files are just over 1GB to download.
