Daily entries from the 17th century diary of Samuel Pepys, republished as a blog and via RSS. A ten year labour of love from Phil Gyford.

The complete Diary had 3,434 entries and it has accumulated c.58,000 annotations from the site's community. Entries are cross referenced by characters and places, and link in to an [encyclopaedia with nearly 5000 entries](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/) for people, places and things. Many entries and places are [located on a map](http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/map/), which is marked up to show the historical locations on a modern map.

The general events of Pepys daily life are [summarised by month and year](http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/summary/)

Pepys also [tweets](https://twitter.com/samuelpepys). Peeps. Pepys should peep, not tweet.
