>Certain cultural objects more than 50 years of age and valued above specified financial thresholds require an individual licence for export out of the United Kingdom whether on a permanent or temporary basis. 


This seems a little dry until you realise that the 11-12 statistics cover 33,000+ objects worth just under £2,000,000,000 (is that 2,000 million, or 2billion in UK English?)

1. Is it so closely connected with our history and national life that its departure would be a misfortune?2. Is it of outstanding aesthetic importance?3. Is it of outstanding significance for the study of some particular branch ofart, learning or history?

The statistics seem to be held in PDFs or an RDF file, with separate PDFs for each table. The RDF claims that CSV files are available, but these don't seem to be linked from the relevant sub-pages.
