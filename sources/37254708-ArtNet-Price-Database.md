The artnet Price Database is 
> the leading illustrated archive of auction records dating back to 1985 for Fine Art, such as photography, sculpture, and works on paper, Design, such as architectural properties, furniture, and lighting, and Decorative Art, such as antiques, jewelry, textiles, and silver. 

It is a [subscription service](https://www.artnet.com/price-database/?1), but basic information about works sold by artist is available publicly - price data requires a login. Artworks for sale, upcoming art events, and artist information are free to access.
