Mechanical Curator's Cuttings is a large (c. 500k) colletion of copyright free small illustrations and ornamentations, from the pages of 17th, 18th and 19th Century books - _curated by a robot_.

The illustrations are derived semi-randomly, semi-thematically from digitised books in the British Library archive using CV and face recognition algorithms. They are posted to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mechanicalcuratorcuttings/) and [Tumblr](http://mechanicalcurator.tumblr.com/about), so available for reuse through those APIs. It [tweets](http://twitter.com/MechCuratorBot), but that is currently (Nov 13) broken.

Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BL-Labs/embellishments)

Ben O'Steen has written up the [idea, code and publishing process](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/10/peeking-behind-the-curtain-of-the-mechanical-curator.html): the full underlying collection data is not currently available, but the published output of the bots represents an open collection of images. There's an [introductory post by James Baker](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/09/the-mechanical-curator.html) dealing with the problems of face recognition, too.
