The Dictionnaire des ventes d'art faites en France et à l'étranger pendant les 18me & 19m siècles by Hippolyte Mireur is volume one of a 9 volume index of every artwork sold at auction between 1700-1900 in Europe.

It is pretty much the sole source of historical pricing data for art.

The versions in the Internet Archive have been scanned, and OCRed but the text is very poorly structured.

## Technical Details

The text versions have very poor character encoding.
