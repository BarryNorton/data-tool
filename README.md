data-tool
=========

A collection of cultural data sets and sources &amp; a website to browse them.


## Adding data

To add a data set, first look through the site to make sure it's not already included.

Then create an Artisanal Integer, and create a file with the format <integer>-name-of-source.md in the sources/ folder.

Use the existing sources as a guide.
